## PART 2: Momentum Trading Strategies

### Timeframe Selection for Crypto Trading  
| Timeframe | Use Case | Risk Level |  
|-----------|----------|------------|  
| Daily | Trend identification | Low |  
| 4-hour | Entry signals | Medium |  
| 1-hour | Short-term trades | High |  

### Moving Average Strategy Framework  
We use:  
- **60-day MA**: Primary trend filter (risk avoidance)  
- **20-day MA**: Entry confirmation (pullback opportunities)  

#### Strategy Implementation  
1. **Bullish Setup**:  
   - Price above 60MA  
   - Pullback to 20MA for entry  
   - Stop-loss below recent swing low  

2. **Bearish Setup**:  
   - Price below 60MA  
   - Resistance test at 20MA for short entry  
   - Stop-loss above resistance zone  

> üìà Example: BTC's 2020-2021 rally saw 14 successful pullback entries to 20MA during uptrend phases  

#### FAQ: Why use moving averages in crypto trading?  
**Q:** How do MAs help in volatile markets?  
**A:** They smooth price action to reveal trend direction. The 60MA acts as a "trend highway" while the 20MA provides entry zones during corrections.

### Risk Management Essentials  
- **Position sizing**: 1-3% of portfolio per trade  
- **Reward:risk ratio**: Minimum 2:1  
- **Time-based exits**: 7-14 day holding period for swing trades  

#### Common Mistakes to Avoid  
| Mistake | Solution |  
|---------|----------|  
| Overtrading | Use weekly/daily filters |  
| Emotional exits | Set automatic stop-loss |  
| Chasing moves | Wait for pullbacks to MAs |
