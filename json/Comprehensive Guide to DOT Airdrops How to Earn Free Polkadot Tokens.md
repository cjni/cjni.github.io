## What Constitutes a DOT Airdrop?

A DOT airdrop involves free token distribution by Polkadot or its ecosystem projects to specific wallet addresses. These events typically serve multiple purposes:
- Rewarding early network adopters
- Encouraging protocol upgrades participation
- Expanding community engagement
- Celebrating network milestones

Unlike token sales, airdrops require no financial investment - just meeting predefined criteria such as wallet activity or social engagement.
