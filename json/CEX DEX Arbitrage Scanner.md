In the crypto space, CEXs and DEXs often display varying liquidity, trading volumes, and price feeds, creating temporary mismatches. The **Alphador Arbitrage Scanner** systematically scans these platforms to identify real-time opportunities where traders can buy low on one exchange and sell high on another.  

### Key Benefits  
- **Time Efficiency**: Reduces manual research by automating opportunity detection.  
- **Diverse Exchange Support**: Covers major CEXs and over 30 DEXs across multiple blockchain networks.  
- **Customizable Filters**: Tailors alerts to specific trading preferences and risk thresholds.

## How the Arbitrage Scanner Works  

The tool operates through a three-step process:  

1. **Scanning**: Continuously monitors price data from CEXs and DEXs.  
2. **Analysis**: Identifies arbitrage opportunities where price discrepancies exceed transaction fees.  
3. **Alerting**: Sends real-time notifications via in-app alerts or Telegram (customizable via filters).  

### Example Scenario  
A trader notices a 2% price gap for ETH/USDT between Bybit (CEX) and Uniswap (DEX). By purchasing ETH on Bybit and selling it on Uniswap, they can lock in a profit after deducting gas and trading fees.

## Customizing Arbitrage Filters  

Users can refine results using **Arbitrage Filters**, which allow:  
- Setting minimum profit thresholds (e.g., 1% or higher).  
- Excluding high-risk tokens with hidden fees or low liquidity.  
- Creating Telegram alerts for specific tokens or exchanges.  

To set up a Telegram filter, simply enable the **Telegram Alert** option when creating a custom filter.

## Risk Management and Disclaimer  

While the Alphador Arbitrage Scanner streamlines opportunity detection, users must conduct due diligence. Risks include:  
- **Hidden Token Taxes**: Some tokens may have undeclared fees that reduce profits.  
- **Slippage**: Rapid price movements on DEXs can erode arbitrage margins.  
- **Network Congestion**: High gas fees on Ethereum during peak times.  

The platform filters out tokens with obvious red flags (e.g., zero liquidity), but users should independently verify token security before trading.
