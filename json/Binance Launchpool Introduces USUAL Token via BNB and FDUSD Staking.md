### Core Features of USUAL  
- **Governance Control:** Token holders influence protocol decisions and financial strategies.  
- **Deflationary Issuance:** New USUAL tokens correlate with USD0 (USD0++) total value locked (TVL), creating scarcity.  
- **Revenue-Linked Inflation:** Supply growth aligns with treasury revenue, ensuring sustainable expansion.  
- **Staking Rewards:** 10% of new issuance goes to USUAL stakers, incentivizing long-term participation.  
- **Gauge Mechanism:** Optimizes liquidity distribution across the protocol.  

### Token Ecosystem  
The protocol operates three tokens:  
1. **USD0:** A stablecoin backed by short-term, liquid, risk-free assets.  
2. **USD0++:** Liquid staking derivative of USD0, distributing rewards via USUAL.  
3. **USUAL:** Governance token capturing protocol revenue and enabling decentralized decision-making.

## Strategic Considerations for Stakers  

### 1. **KYC Requirement**  
Only users with completed KYC verification can participate.

Sub-accounts cannot join; only main and standard accounts qualify.  

### 3. **Transfer Limitations**  
Deposits, withdrawals, and transfers are suspended during the event.

Staked assets remain liquid but earn rewards hourly. Unclaimed tokens can be withdrawn to spot wallets at any time.  

### 5. **Fraud Prevention**  
Binance monitors for abusive behavior, including multiple accounts from the same IP or device.

## Final Thoughts on USUAL and Binance Launchpool  

The USUAL project exemplifies the evolving landscape of decentralized finance, blending stablecoin innovation with governance-driven yield. For participants, the Launchpool mechanism offers a low-barrier entry to acquire tokens before they hit the open market. However, stakers should weigh:  
- **Risk of Impermanent Loss:** While FDUSD is a stablecoin, USD0 peg stability remains critical.  
- **Reward Dilution:** High participation rates may reduce individual earnings.  

By strategically allocating between BNB and FDUSD pools, users can optimize their exposure to both USUAL governance and Binanceâ€™s broader ecosystem.
