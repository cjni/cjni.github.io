## FAQs: Cryptocurrency Market Analysis

### How do geopolitical crises affect crypto prices?  
Historical data shows short-term volatility spikes during conflicts, but long-term adoption often accelerates due to trust erosion in traditional financial systems. The 2022 Ukraine-Russia conflict saw Bitcoin drop 70% initially but recover within 6 months.

### Are stablecoins safe during market downturns?  
Algorithmic stablecoins face redemption risks, while fiat-backed reserves (e.g., USDT, USDC) maintain better stability. The GENIUS Act aims to standardize reserve requirements but remains under regulatory debate.

### What investment strategies work during crypto winters?  
Dollar-cost averaging, derivatives hedging, and focus on Layer 1 ecosystems with strong fundamentals (BTC, ETH, Solana) have proven effective. Sovereign adoption tracking also identifies emerging opportunities.
