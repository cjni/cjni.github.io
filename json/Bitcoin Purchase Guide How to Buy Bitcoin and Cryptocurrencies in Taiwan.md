## Method 1: Currency Exchanges  

**Currency exchanges** function similarly to traditional foreign exchange services, offering fixed buy/sell rates for cryptocurrencies. Two major platforms dominate Taiwanâ€™s market: **MaiCoin** and **BitoEX**, which specialize in converting TWD (New Taiwan Dollar) to crypto and vice versa.  

### Transaction Process  

- **Buying Cryptocurrency**  
  1. Visit the exchange platform and specify the amount of crypto you wish to purchase.  
  2. The platform calculates the required TWD amount based on the current exchange rate.  
  3. Complete payment via online banking, ATM transfer, or convenience store payment codes.  
  4. The purchased cryptocurrency is instantly credited to your account.  

- **Selling Cryptocurrency**  
  1. Initiate a sell order for your chosen crypto.  
  2. Upon completion, convert the crypto to TWD.  
  3. To withdraw TWD, complete **KYC (Know Your Customer)** verification and link a bank account.  
  4. Funds typically take 1â€“3 business days to arrive in your bank account.

## Method 2: Cryptocurrency Trading Platforms  

**Cryptocurrency exchanges** act as intermediaries where users can trade directly with others. These platforms require account registration, identity verification, and fund deposits before trading. They fall into two categories:  
- **Fiat-supported exchanges**: Allow direct TWD deposits for crypto purchases.  
- **Crypto-to-crypto exchanges**: Require pre-existing crypto balances for trading.  

### Transaction Process  

- **Buying Cryptocurrency**  
  1. Deposit TWD into your exchange account via bank transfer or ATM.  
  2. Place a buy order at your desired price or accept the market rate.  
  3. Once matched with a seller, the crypto is transferred to your wallet.  

- **Selling Cryptocurrency**  
  1. Place a sell order specifying the amount and price.  
  2. After a buyer matches your order, receive TWD in your exchange account.  
  3. Withdraw TWD to your bank account after completing KYC and linking your bank details.  

### Pros and Cons  

| **Advantages**               | **Disadvantages**              |  
|-------------------------------|-------------------------------|  
| Diverse crypto selection      | Complex registration process  |  
| Market-driven pricing         | Potential security risks      |  
| Liquidity for popular pairs   | Withdrawal processing delays  |

## Method 3: OTC (Over-the-Counter) Trading  

**OTC markets** facilitate peer-to-peer (P2P) transactions between buyers and sellers. This method is ideal for large-volume trades or users seeking competitive rates.  

### Transaction Process  

- **Private P2P Transactions**  
  1. Agree on terms (price, payment method) directly with the counterparty.  
  2. Transfer funds via bank transfer or in-person cash exchange.  
  3. Release crypto from escrow once payment confirmation is received.  

- **OTC Platforms**  
  1. Create a buy/sell advertisement on platforms like 8591 or Shopee-like crypto exchanges.  
  2. Buyers deposit funds, and sellers release crypto after verifying payments.  
  3. Platforms often hold crypto in escrow to ensure transaction security.  

### Pros and Cons  

| **Advantages**               | **Disadvantages**              |  
|-------------------------------|-------------------------------|  
| Competitive pricing           | Risk of scams or fraud        |  
| Fast fund transfers           | Limited buyer/seller protection|  
| Flexibility in payment methods|                               |
